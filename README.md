# BOOK_RECOMMENDATION

Recommender systems are one of the most successful and widespread application of machine learning technologies in business.
You can apply recommender systems in scenarios where many users interact with many items.You can find large scale recommender systems in retail, video on demand, or music streaming. In order to develop and maintain such systems, a company typically needs a group of expensive data scientist and engineers. That is why even large corporates such as BBC decided to outsource its recommendation services

Machine learning algorithms in recommender systems are typically classified into two categories â€” content based and collaborative filtering methods although modern recommenders combine both approaches. Content based methods are based on similarity of item attributes and collaborative methods calculate similarity from interactions. Below we discuss mostly collaborative methods enabling users to discover new content dissimilar to items viewed in the past.

The following repository contains collaborative based filtering using pearsons coefficient correlation and KNN algprithm.
